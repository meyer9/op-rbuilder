//! Block-STM: Parallel Transaction Execution Engine for EVM
//!
//! This module implements a parallel execution engine for EVM transactions based on
//! the Block-STM algorithm. Block-STM enables speculative parallel execution by:
//!
//! 1. Executing all transactions in parallel speculatively
//! 2. Tracking read/write sets during execution
//! 3. Detecting conflicts via push-based invalidation
//! 4. Re-executing conflicting transactions
//! 5. Committing results in transaction order
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`types`]: Core types (TxnIndex, Version, EvmStateKey)
//! - [`mv_hashmap`]: Multi-version data structure for concurrent state access
//! - [`captured_reads`]: Read set tracking during execution
//! - [`view`]: Versioned state view implementing revm's Database trait
//! - [`scheduler`]: Transaction scheduling and abort management
//! - [`executor`]: Main parallel execution orchestrator
